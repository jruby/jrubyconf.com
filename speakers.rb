    :bio     => "<p>Jim Weirich first learned about computers when his college adviser suggested he take a computer science course: \"It will be useful, and you might enjoy it.\" With those prophetic words, Jim has been developing now for over 25 years, working with everything from crunching rocket launch data on supercomputers to wiring up servos and LEDs on micro-controllers.  Currently he loves working in Ruby and Rails as the Chief Scientist at EdgeCase, but you can also find him strumming on his ukulele as time permits.</p>",
